## Codeprof - THE Coding Education Platform

Codeprof is a coding platform allowing teachers to create coding problems that
can then be assigned to their students in classrooms.

Codeprof allows teachers to not only create the questions, but also create inputs 
the code should be tested on along with expected outputs, enabling Codeprof to 
evaluate student submissions on complex test cases.
