classroom route functions:

I) get_questions - displays questions for students and teachers, with three options
    1 - all questions for a specific teacher. JSON is question name and success rate for each question
    2 - all questions for a specific classroom. JSON is question name and success rate for each question
    3 - all questions for a specific student in a specific classroom. JSON is question name, number of
    submissions and due date for each question

II) get_classroom_students

For both teacher_route and classroom_route - get_questions_function - student_view, should maybe check if the user exists, otherwise
people could hardcode into the url a user that doesn't exist


teacher
get all their questions, submissions percentage success


                # # Get the latest submission's is_accepted value
                # latest_submission = conn.execute('''
                #     SELECT is_accepted, date
                #     FROM submission
                #     WHERE question = ? AND user = ?
                #     ORDER BY date DESC
                #     LIMIT 1
                # ''', (question['question_id'], student_id)).fetchone()
                
                # latest_attempt_accepted = None
                # latest_attempt_date = None
                
                # if latest_submission:
                #     latest_attempt_accepted = latest_submission['is_accepted']
                #     latest_attempt_date = latest_submission['date']



PASSLIB.HASH - BCRYPT
https://martinheinz.dev/blog/59
slow hash functions are used for password hashing making it much more inefficient for attacker to brute-force a password. 
We then modify the hasher to use higher number of rounds (cost factor) making the hashing faster and therefore, hashes less secure. 
This number should be the largest possible that doesn't cause intolerable delay for your users (~300ms).
 passlib updates default rounds value periodically, so your don't necessarily need to change this value


timing attack:
By analyzing these response times, an attacker can indirectly gather information leaked by the application. 
This technique can be used for malicious purposes, such as guessing a user's password or breaking encryption methods. 
Side-channel attacks exploit unintended information leakage from a system
