classroom route functions:

I) get_questions - displays questions for students and teachers, with three options
    1 - all questions for a specific teacher. JSON is question name and success rate for each question
    2 - all questions for a specific classroom. JSON is question name and success rate for each question
    3 - all questions for a specific student in a specific classroom. JSON is question name, number of
    submissions and due date for each question

II) get_classroom_students

For both teacher_route and classroom_route - get_questions_function - student_view, should maybe check if the user exists, otherwise
people could hardcode into the url a user that doesn't exist
